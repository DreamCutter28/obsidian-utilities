# Dataview Scripts for Obsidian

This folder contains my collection of Dataview scripts intended to assist in automating tasks and managing Obsidian vaults more effectively.

## Installation

1. Ensure that the [Dataview Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=dataview) is installed and enabled in Obsidian.

2. **Adding a Script**:
   - Open Obsidian and navigate to the desired vault.
   - Create a new note or open an existing one.
   - Insert a **Dataview JS code block** by typing:
     ````
     ``` dataviewjs
     // The script code should be placed here
     ```
     ````
   - Copy and paste the script from this repository into the `dataviewjs` block.

3. **Adjusting Parameters (Optional)**:
   - If a script requires specific parameters (such as a file or folder path, tags, or other values), modify the default values in the script as needed.
